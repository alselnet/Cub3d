Cub3d

--------------------------------
We are J. Thuysbaert (https://github.com/Joule444) and A. Selnet (https://github.com/alselnet), both students @42 School, Paris. 
This was our attempt at a fully-fledged linux-based raycaster, entirely in C. We had the constraints of using 42's graphics library, the infamous minilibx, alongside a very limited of basic C libraries.

--------------------------------
Quick How-to-use guide :

- clone our Repo
- make
- ./cub3d "map filename" (ie ./cub3d valid_laby.cub)
  (you can find other maps in /maps, even create one yourself on the same model)

---------------------------------
Some of the useful resource we used :

Lode Vandevenne's very exhaustive documentation about the principles of raycasting, in two parts :

This very good refresher on trigonometry : https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trigonometry.html
